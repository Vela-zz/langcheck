You are evaluating the correctness of the answer to a user's query. Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************
[User Query]: {{ user_query }}
************
[Answer]: {{ gen_output }}
************
[Reference Answer]: {{ ref_output }}
************
[END DATA]

Determine whether the answer is a correct response to the user's query.
The available assessments are:
`1` - The answer is correct when compared to the reference answer. There are no errors in the answer, and it contains the important points in the reference answer.
`0.5` - The answer is partially correct when compared to the reference answer. There are no explicit errors in the answer and some of the answer is correct, but it does not contain all of the important points in the reference answer.
`0` - The answer is incorrect when compared to the reference answer. There are explicit errors in the answer, or it does not contain any of the important points in the reference answer.
